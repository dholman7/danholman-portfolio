# Dan Holman Portfolio - Main Project Rules

## Project Overview
Professional portfolio showcasing test automation, cloud-native development, and AI-powered testing expertise.

### Key Modules:
- **automation-framework/**: Python/TypeScript test automation with Page Object pattern, GraphQL/REST API testing, and Pact contract testing
- **cloud-native-app/**: AWS serverless demo with Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Infrastructure as Code
- **ai-rulesets/**: AI-powered development standards and quality tools
- **react-playwright-demo/**: Modern React 19 frontend with comprehensive E2E testing
- **case-studies/**: Technical writeups on testing strategies and CI/CD practices
- **ai-private/**: Private submodule containing sensitive prompts, agent rules, and datasets

## General Guidelines
- **Production-ready code** with comprehensive documentation and testing
- **Security-first** principles for all implementations
- **NEVER commit test reports, Allure results, or generated files to git**
- Use **kebab-case** for directory and file names
- Organize tests alongside source code
- Follow **semantic versioning** and **conventional commits**
- Prefer absolute paths resolved from the repository root

## MANDATORY Testing Requirements
- **ALWAYS run tests before committing** - no exceptions
- **Server sanity check** before E2E tests (verify `yarn dev` works)
- **Complete test suite** must pass before considering work "done"
- **Automatic testing** - Cursor should run tests automatically
- **No commits** if any test fails or server doesn't start
- **Lint, test, build** - all must pass before any commit
