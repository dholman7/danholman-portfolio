# Git and Version Control Rules

## Git Workflow
- **NEVER commit or push changes without explicit permission from the repository owner**
- **NEVER push directly to main branch - always use Pull Requests**
- **ALWAYS use the complete @pull_request_template.md for all Pull Requests**
- Always ask for approval before making any git operations (commit, push, merge, etc.)
- Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format
- Create feature branches for significant changes
- Request code review for all changes before merging
- Never force push to main branch
- Always pull latest changes before starting work

## Pull Request Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Use the complete pull request template located at `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- **MANDATORY**: Fill out ALL sections of the PR template completely
- **MANDATORY**: Check all relevant checkboxes in the template
- **MANDATORY**: Provide detailed descriptions of changes made
- **MANDATORY**: Include test results and evidence of testing
- **MANDATORY**: Add screenshots/demos when applicable
- **MANDATORY**: Link related issues and provide context
- **MANDATORY**: Complete the reviewer checklist
- **MANDATORY**: Tag appropriate reviewers (@dholman7)
- **MANDATORY**: Ensure all CI/CD checks pass before requesting review

## Branch Protection Rules
- Main branch is protected and requires Pull Request reviews
- No direct pushes to main branch allowed
- All Pull Requests must pass CI/CD checks
- All Pull Requests must be reviewed and approved
- All Pull Requests must use the complete template

## Pull Request Workflow
1. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/description-of-change`
2. **Make Changes**: Implement the feature/fix with proper testing
3. **Commit Changes**: Use conventional commit format
4. **Push Branch**: `git push origin feature/description-of-change`
5. **Create Pull Request**: Use GitHub UI with complete template
6. **Fill Template**: Complete ALL sections of the PR template
7. **Request Review**: Tag @dholman7 and wait for approval
8. **Address Feedback**: Make requested changes and update PR
9. **Merge**: Only after approval and all checks pass

## Commit Message Format
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Use imperative mood: "Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to..."
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues: "Closes #123"

## Files to NEVER Commit
- **Test Reports**: Never commit test reports, Allure results, or coverage reports
- **Generated Files**: Never commit generated files, build artifacts, or temporary files
- **Sensitive Data**: Never commit secrets, API keys, passwords, or sensitive configuration
- **IDE Files**: Never commit IDE-specific files (.vscode/, .idea/, etc.)
- **OS Files**: Never commit OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Never commit node_modules/, .venv/, __pycache__/, etc.
- **Logs**: Never commit log files or temporary output files

## Allure and Test Reporting
- **NEVER commit Allure results** (`allure-results/`, `allure-report/`)
- **NEVER commit test reports** (`reports/`, `htmlcov/`, coverage files)
- **NEVER commit JUnit XML reports** or other test output files
- Test reports are generated during CI/CD and should not be versioned
- Use GitHub Actions artifacts or external storage for test reports
- Configure Allure to generate reports in CI/CD pipeline only
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude all test reporting directories

## Security and Privacy
- Never commit files containing sensitive information
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data in CI/CD
- Review all files before committing
- Use tools like `git-secrets` to prevent accidental commits
- Follow the principle of "public by default, private by exception"
