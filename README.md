- **Artifact Management**: Build artifact collection and distribution
- **Environment Management**: Proper secret and configuration management
- **Monitoring Integration**: Test result aggregation and reporting

### **Artifact Path Structure**

The CI/CD pipeline uses a specific artifact pathing structure for reliable report deployment:

#### **Portfolio Test Suite Workflow** (`.github/workflows/portfolio-test-suite.yml`)
- **Working Directories**: Each module runs in its own working directory
- **Artifact Upload Paths**: 
  - Allure Reports: `{module}/reports/allure-report/`
  - Coverage Reports: `{module}/reports/coverage/`
  - Allure Results: `{module}/reports/allure-results/`
- **Artifact Names**: `{module}-allure-report`, `{module}-coverage-report`, `{module}-allure-results`

#### **Deploy Allure Reports Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy-allure-reports.yml`)
- **Artifact Download**: Downloads artifacts with pattern `*-allure-report`, `*-coverage-report`
- **Path Mapping**: Handles nested directory structure from working directories
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Maps artifacts to `https://dholman7.github.io/danholman-portfolio/{module}/`

#### **Path Resolution Logic**
```bash
# Artifact structure after download:
allure-reports/
├── automation-framework-allure-report/
│   └── automation-framework/reports/allure-report/  # Nested path from working directory
├── ai-rulesets-allure-report/
│   └── ai-rulesets/reports/allure-report/
└── ...

# Deploy workflow handles both possible paths:
# 1. {artifact-name}/{module}/reports/allure-report/
# 2. {artifact-name}/reports/allure-report/
```

```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting CI/CD Issues

### **Artifact Path Issues**

If you see "Reports will be available after test execution" on GitHub Pages, check these common issues:

#### **Issue 1: Artifact Path Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Deploy workflow can't find artifacts due to nested directory structure
- **Cause**: Working directories create nested paths in artifacts
- **Solution**: Deploy workflow handles both possible paths automatically

#### **Issue 2: Missing Allure Reports**
- **Problem**: No Allure reports generated during test execution
- **Cause**: Tests may have failed or Allure generation step failed
- **Solution**: Check GitHub Actions logs for test execution and Allure generation steps

#### **Issue 3: Coverage Reports Not Found**
- **Problem**: Coverage reports show placeholder pages
- **Cause**: Coverage generation failed or path resolution issues
- **Solution**: Verify pytest coverage commands and artifact upload paths

#### **Debug Steps**
1. **Check GitHub Actions**: View the "Portfolio Test Suite with Coverage" workflow run
2. **Verify Artifacts**: Look for uploaded artifacts in the Actions tab
3. **Check Deploy Logs**: Review the "Deploy Allure Reports to GitHub Pages" workflow logs
4. **Path Structure**: Ensure artifacts follow the documented path structure

### **Path Structure Reference**

```bash
# Expected artifact structure:
allure-reports/
├── automation-framework-allure-report/
│   └── automation-framework/reports/allure-report/
├── ai-rulesets-allure-report/
│   └── ai-rulesets/reports/allure-report/
└── ...

# Deploy workflow handles both paths:
# 1. {artifact-name}/{module}/reports/allure-report/
# 2. {artifact-name}/reports/allure-report/
```

## 🔍 Code Quality Validation

- **README files**: Accuracy, broken links, outdated references, and structure
- **GitHub workflows**: YAML syntax, required fields, and best practices
- **Test execution**: Coverage, reporting, and integration across all modules
- **Allure reporting**: Configuration and report generation validation

### **Quick Quality Check**
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality validation
make quality-check

# Check specific aspects
make quality-readmes      # README validation
make quality-workflows    # Workflow validation
make quality-tests        # Test execution validation

# Automatically fix common issues
make quality-fix          # Check and fix issues automatically

# Or run directly
python scripts/quality_checker.py
python scripts/quality_checker.py --fix
```

### **Quality Checker Features**

3. **Configuration**: Cursor CLI uses the repository's `.cursor/rules/` for context-aware fixes

**Example Workflow Integration:**
```yaml
- name: Fix Test Failures with Cursor
  if: failure() && github.event.inputs.enable_cursor_fixes != false
  env:
    CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
  run: |
    cursor-agent -p "IMPORTANT: Do NOT create branches, commit, push, or post PR comments. 
    Only modify files in the working directory. 
    Analyze test failures and fix Python/TypeScript test files. 
    Focus on import errors, method mismatches, and API compatibility issues."
```

- **Custom Ruleset Generation**: Process company documentation into AI-compatible rulesets
- **Multi-tool Integration**: Generate rulesets for Cursor, Copilot, and other AI tools
- **Team Distribution**: Share and maintain standards across development teams

### Getting Started with AI Development

1. **Choose Your AI Tool**: Start with GitHub Copilot for code completion or Cursor for full AI editing
2. **Set Up Context**: Use the `.cursor/rules/` configuration to provide project context
3. **Start Small**: Begin with simple tasks like generating tests or documentation
4. **Iterate and Learn**: Review AI suggestions and refine your prompts
5. **Scale Up**: Gradually use AI for more complex development tasks

### Best Practices

- **Always Review**: Never blindly accept AI-generated code
- **Provide Context**: Give clear, specific instructions to AI tools
- **Maintain Quality**: Use AI to enhance, not replace, good coding practices
- **Stay Updated**: AI tools evolve rapidly, keep up with new features
- **Security First**: Be cautious with AI-generated code in security-sensitive areas
