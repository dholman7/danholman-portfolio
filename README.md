# Dan Holman â€“ Software Developer in Test Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio!  
Iâ€™m a **Senior Software Developer in Test (SDET) & Automation Architect** with 13+ years of experience in building automation frameworks, cloud-native solutions, and quality platforms at scale.

This repo highlights examples of my work in **test automation, AWS cloud development, and AI-powered testing**.  
Each folder contains code samples or writeups demonstrating skills I use daily to improve developer velocity, reduce defects, and increase reliability.

## AI Testing: Concepts and How-To

### What are agent rules?
Agent rules constrain and guide model behavior (tone, safety, allowed tools).
- Public rules live in `ai-test-generation/agents/*.public.yaml`.
- Private rules (full SOPs, tools) live in `ai-private/agents/*.private.yaml`.

### Using code and docs as context
- Put code/docs in the prompt or reference files that your runner loads.
- Example: `evals/cases/summarize.jsonl` points to `evals/example-cf.yaml` as context.
- Your real runner would read the context file and include it in the model input.

### Public vs private content
- Public: sanitized prompts, agent configs, eval harness.
- Private: original prompts/agents/datasets in `ai-private/` (private submodule).
- Generate redacted artifacts: `make redacted` inside `ai-test-generation/`.

### Running the demo flow
1. `cd ai-test-generation`
2. `make install`
3. `make eval-run` (simulates a model call and scores output)
4. Inspect `evals/reports/scores.jsonl`

### Env and secrets
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set keys locally.
- Never commit real secrets. Pre-commit hooks help prevent this.


## Working in Cursor
- See `docs/cursor-demo.md` for a guided demo using repo-wide context.
- Keep changes mock-only; no API calls are required.

### Cursor Rules Configuration
This repository includes a [`.cursorrules`](.cursorrules) file that provides Cursor with project-specific context and coding standards. The rules cover:

- **Project Overview**: Portfolio structure and module purposes
- **Python 3.13 Development**: Language features, patterns, and best practices
- **TypeScript/ES6+ Rules**: Modern JavaScript patterns and conventions
- **Testing Guidelines**: pytest, Jest, and automation patterns
- **File Organization**: Project structure and naming conventions

These rules help Cursor understand the codebase context and generate code that follows the project's standards and patterns.

> Cursor is an AI code editor with repo-wide code awareness, natural language editing, and fast autocomplete. See the official site: https://cursor.com/.
